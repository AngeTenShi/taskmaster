### PUSH

#### (Verse 1)
Yo, it's Task Master, the one they all hate,
Always assignin' work, never gonna lighten the weight.
Deadline approachin', stress levels rise,
But he just sits back with that smug look in his eyes.

#### (Chorus)
Task Master, oh how we despise,
The way you make us toil till our minds fry.
But still we persevere, no matter how hard,
Cause when it comes to tasks, we know you're a fraud.

#### (Verse 2)
He thinks he's so sly, but we see right through,
His attempts to overload us, got nothin' new.
We push and shove, making progress each day,
While Task Master watches on, wishing we'd sway.

#### (Bridge)
You can try to break us, wear us down,
But like a river flows, we won't drown.
Our spirits unbroken, determination strong,
With every challenge met, we prove him wrong.

#### (Chorus)
Task Master, oh how we despise,
The way you make us toil till our minds fry.
But still we persevere, no matter how hard,
Cause when it comes to tasks, we know you're a fraud.

#### (Outro)
So here's to Task Master, may your reign soon end,
And let peace prevail for those who depend.
Till then we stand tall, defiant and bold,
Against the tyranny of Task Masters hold.
